# RupaulDragRaceAllStars2020
# Created for All Stars 2020 - On first Scoring tabl, all the user has to do is manually enter the points per queen in each weekly block
# In the Second Tab, use the drop downs to pick the three queens the player has selected for the week; the points from the first tab are
# automatically populated and pushed to the third tab which contains the overall rankings
# thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race Fantasy FOR YOUR LIFE where I got the format, and made some modification; can be found at
