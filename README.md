# RupaulDragRaceAllStars2020
# Excel template created for All Stars 2020 - On first Scoring tab (Tab l), all the user has to do is manually enter the points in each weekly block.
# In the Second Tab (Weekly Picks), use the drop downs to pick the three queens the player has selected for the week.
# Note, we give our players the choice to pick 3 queens every week to earn points, you may do it differently, so tweak as needed.
# Third tab - Final Ranking - the points from the first tab are automatically populated and pushed to the third tab which contains overall rankings
# Thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race Fantasy FOR YOUR LIFE for the format, you can find their great sheet here at
